EU Climate Neutrality Target:
1) Target: 55% emissions reduction by 2050.
2) Target: Zero net emissions by 2040.
3) Target: Gradual reduction until zero emissions by end of century.
4) Target: Zero net emissions by 2050.

Climate Neutrality vs. Carbon Neutrality:
1) Yes, they're the same: Limit GHG emissions to what nature absorbs.
2) No, only climate neutrality is used, referring to GHG limitation.
3) No, climate neutrality limits GHG emissions; carbon neutrality focuses on CO2 balance.
4) No, climate neutrality balances GHG emissions; carbon neutrality focuses on CO2 cycle.
3
Greenhouse Gases (GHG) Composition:
1) GHGs: CO2 and ozone, with CO2 as most abundant.
2) GHGs: CO2, methane, nitrous oxide, chlorofluorocarbons, ozone, water vapor, with CO2 at 80%.
3) No precise info besides CO2, ozone, water vapor.
4) Composition varies; besides CO2, no general evaluation.

Economic and Social Impact of Climate Neutrality:
1) Transition brings economic opportunities, growth, jobs, and tech development.
2) Transition brings only higher economic costs, no opportunities.
3) Transition brings economic and social benefits, no higher costs.
4) Transition has no economic or social consequences.
3
Carbon Dioxide Utilization:
1) No technological research on CO2 transformation.
2) Many studies exist but not economically developed due to challenges.
3) New industrial developments utilize CO2 emissions.
4) No interest due to technological and economic difficulties.
2
Progress Targets in EU Law:
1) EU Climate Law adopted in 2021 targets climate neutrality.
2) No specific EU Climate Law; addressed in other laws and documents.
3) Proposal for EU Climate Law in public debate.
4) Existing EU Climate Law may be replaced for better alignment.
